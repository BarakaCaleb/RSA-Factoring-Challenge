The RSA Algorithm (Rives-Shamir-Adleman) is the basis of a cryptosystem -- a suite of cryptographic algorithms that are used for specific security services.

It enables public key encryption and is widely used to secure sensitive data, paricularly when it is used when data is sent over an insecure network such as the internet.
